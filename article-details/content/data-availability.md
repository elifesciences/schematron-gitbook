# Data availability

## What is the data availability section?

The data availability section is intended to provide readers with information on how they can access the data being reported in an article. eLife strongly encourages authors to deposit their generated data in a dedicated, open repository so that it is available for further study and efforts to replicate their results. The data section should also give details of any previously published datasets that the authors used.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-11.15.49.png)

This section consists of three parts - the data availability statement, generated datasets and previously published datasets.

* **Data availability statement**: a short paragraph describing the data that has been generated and where it has been deposited. If all the data is contained in the article and supporting files, or no data was generated at all, this will be stated instead.
* **Generated datasets**: reference details for all generated datasets. These are entered as data references but are listed here rather than in the main reference list. Full bibliographic details are required for each entry \(author list, year, title, database, a direct link and an identifier\).
* **Previously published datasets**: reference details for all previous datasets that were used. Same as the above, only for data that was used in the work reported, rather than generated by it.

In research content, the data availability statement is mandatory. The other two parts are optional, depending on whether any major datasets were generated or used. If only a small amount of data was generated, the authors may chose to include it as source data files for their article rather than submitting it to a repository, meaning no datasets need to be listed in this section. Relatedly, if previously published data was taken wholly from a journal article rather than from a repository, citing that article in the main text is sufficient and no entry in the data availability section is required. Finally, in the case where no data was generated at all, the data availability statement should reflect this.

## What needs to be checked?

### Data availability statement

The data availability statement should be a single paragraph consisting of complete sentences, ending in a full stop. Spelling and grammar errors should be corrected in the same manner as the main text.



### Generated datasets



### Previously published datasets



## Examples

### Adding datasets
