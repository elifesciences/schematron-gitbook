**Warning**: _XXXXXX permissions - the &lt;license-p&gt; for all rights reserved type permissions should usually end with 'further reproduction of this panel/figure would need permission from the copyright holder.', but XXXXXX's doesn't.

**Action**: If the copyright statement for a figure includes 'All rights reserved', the permissions statement should end with 'further reproduction of this panel/figure would need permission from the copyright holder' - you just need to add it in if this is missing. If there is no '[**https://creativecommons.org/**](https://creativecommons.org/)' type link, the schematron will automatically assume the figure permission is 'All rights reserved' - query the Production team to check this is correct.
