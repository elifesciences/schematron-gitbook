# Asset source files

## What are asset source files?

Figures \(and their supplements\), videos and tables may be accompanied by the source data and/or source code that was used to generate them. The source data will usually consist of tables of raw data but may also include unprocessed images, editable version of charts provided as flat images, or mutliple-page documents that cannot be typeset as single figures/figure supplements. Source code will usually comprise scripts that were used to process the data or to generate the graphs shown in figures.

Source data accompanying an article asset is far more common than source code since scripts and other code are more usually to be uploaded at the article level, or submitted to an online repository \(see [**Archiving code**](../../../toolkit/archiving-code.md) for more details on this\).
