# Additional files

## What are additional files?

Besides the figures, figure supplements, tables and videos that are presented throughout an article, eLife also allows authors to include files that can be downloaded to support their findings. These can be uploaded at the level of the entire article \(in which case they sit in an 'additional files' section at the back of the article\) or to accompany particular display assets \(that is, they will be associated with a figure, table or video\). eLife allows the following varieties of additional file.

### Audio files

At present, eLife cannot support inline audio-only playback so audio files \(as distinct from videos\) should be included as additional files. These are treated in all respects like [**Supplementary files**](asset-source-files.md#supplementary-files), but are labelled as as Audio file 1, Audio file 2, etc.

They are published in the Additional files section. A descriptive title should be provided for each file and a legend may be present as well.

### Reporting standards

Reporting standard documents describe particular protocols and standards that the authors followed when they were collecting their results. These generally take the form of check-lists. Please note that these are entirely distinct from the transparent reporting form that eLife requests authors complete on submission.

They are labelled as Reporting standard 1, Reporting standard 2, etc. A descriptive title should be provided and they are published in the Additional files section.

### Source files \(article-level\)

Source data and source code may be provided to give readers access to the raw data and the scripts that were used to process it. During the submission process, authors are in fact encouraged to provide these files to aid the reviewers and, in the event of acceptance, to allow readers to easily reproduce the work.

In the event that the data is too large or extensive to be neatly captured within one or two Excel files, it may be uploaded as a generated dataset to an external repository. In such cases, it should not be listed as a source data file but instead described in the [**Data availability section**](../data-availability.md). See **below** for how to deal with cases where authors become confused on this point.

Source code may also be uploaded to an external repository such as GitHub and this is often preferable to being included as an attached file as it permits proper licensing of the code \(see [**Archiving code**](../../../toolkit/archiving-code.md) for more details on this\). Again, if source code is hosted away from the article, it should not be listed as a source code file.

These file-types are labelled respectively Source data 1, Source data 2, etc. and Source code 1, Source code 2, etc. Each source data and source code file should have a descriptive title and may be accompanied by a legend. They are published in the Additional files section at the back of the article.

### Source files \(asset-level

Figures \(and their supplements\), videos and tables may be accompanied by the source data and/or source code that was used to generate them. The source data will usually consist of tables of raw data but may also include unprocessed images, editable version of charts provided as flat images, or multiple-page documents that cannot be typeset as single figures/figure supplements. Source code will usually comprise scripts that were used to process the data or to generate the graphs shown in figures.

To indicate that they are associated with a display asset, these files will be named Figure 1—source data 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1, Table 3—source data 1, Video 4—source data 1, etc. and Figure 1—source code 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source code 1, Table 3—source code 1, Video 4—source code 1, etc. The numbering restarts for each asset e.g. Figure 1—source data 1, Figure 2—source data 1, Figure 2—source data 2, Figure 3—source data 1. Like article-level source data and source code files, they should have a descriptive title and may be accompanied by a legend. They are displayed in context with the main asset to which they relate.

### Supplementary files

When authors have accompanying documents that do not fit into the other categories of additional file, they may include these as supplementary files. These can cover lists of plasmids, operating manuals for resources, experimental design documentation, supporting tables that do not count as source data, lists of datasets used, and so on. Broadly speaking it is preferable that authors use one of the specific categories of file and include tables in their main text but eLife accepts this is not always possible.

Supplementary files are published in the Additional files section and should have a descriptive title. A legend may also be provided with a fuller description of the file contents.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-04-20-at-12.44.56.png)

### Transparent reporting form

To facilitate the interpretation and replication of experiments, authors as asked during full submission to provide information relating to sample-size estimation, replicates, and statistical reporting. They are encouraged to fill out a template form \(available as a [**PDF**](https://elife-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/xpub/guides/transparent_reporting.pdf) ****or a [**Word file**](https://elife-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/xpub/guides/transparent_reporting.docx)\) describing the places within the article where this information has been included. This transparent reporting form is them published alongside the version of record.

It is important to note that while TRFs accompany most articles, they are not mandatory. If, for example, an article does not describe experiments or the analysis of data \(as might be the case in a Tools and Resources submission\), the form would not be applicable.

Transparent reporting forms do not require a title or legend and are published at the end of the Additional files section.

## What needs to be checked?

* Appropriateness of the file-type
* Relationship to asset \(where applicable\)
* Inappropriate/mistaken inclusion of an additional file
* Corrupted files

### Appropriateness of the file-type

Sometimes, authors will submit files using one additional file type where it would have been better for them to use another. For instance, a Supplementary file 1 with the title 'Source data for first experiment' should really have been Source data 1 and should be updated accordingly. Likewise if a source data file's title or legend indicate it is in fact code, this should be changed to source code.

Occasionally, this kind of issue can affect transparent reporting forms, with authors uploading them as reporting standards instead. If not title has been provided for a reporting standard, it is worth downloading the file and comparing it to the TRF template mentioned [**above**](asset-source-files.md#transparent-reporting-form). If it is clearly a transparent reporting form, it should be relabelled accordingly.

### Relationship to asset \(where applicable\)

As indicated by the relevant schematron tests, asset-level source data and code should be relate directly to the asset with which it is associated. That is to say, if Figure 1—source data 1 relates only to Figure 1—figure supplement 2, it should be changed to Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1. Likewise, if the title for source data at the article level indicates a relationship to a figure \(e.g. "Source data 1. Original data for Figure 5"\) it should be changed to asset-level source data for that figure.

That being said, when a source file covers multiple assets, it may be more appropriate to leave it as provided. For example, if Figure 2—source data 1 relates to both Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, it should remain associated directly with Figure 2. If a source code file \(at the article level\) relates to multiple figures, it is appropriate as Source code 1 since it would not be quite accurate to label it as source code for any one of the figures covered.

### Inappropriate/mistaken inclusion of an additional file

Another issue that can occur during submission is that authors include additional files that should have been either a 'Related Manuscript File' \(file uploaded for peer review that is not required for final publication\) or a 'LaTex Support File' \(a supporting file for a LaTex submission e.g. a .sty style file or a .bib bibliography file\). Examples of this would include a marked-up PDF of the article showing tracked changes for reviewers, a copy of the article provided for the publication on acceptance, and a .bib file providing the article's reference list. It is usually clear when this is the case as no title or legend will have been provided for the additional file and its author-provided file name will indicate its purpose as one of the given examples. In these situations, the additional file should be removed from the proof.

Where it is unclear whether the file is required for final publication, the author should be asked to double check that it is needed and provide a title where appropriate.

Occasionally, authors will provide a LaTex \(.tex\) file as an additional file, under the assumption that we will typeset it for them. If they do so, they must be asked to provide a PDF version of this file so that it will be available in an easy-to-read format for publication.

* We noticed that you have provided a .tex file as an additional file. Please could you provide a typeset PDF version of this file that we can use for final publication?

One final case of this kind of issue is when authors provide an appendix as a supplementary file. That is, they refer to the file as an appendix in their text or file name and had intended for it to be typeset as such. If this occurs, the file should usually be incorporated into the main text. It may be necessary to query the author for full-resolution images or an editable version of the appendix file. Ideally, the content processors should alert the eLife production team if they encounter an additional file named as an appendix so that this can be sorted out before the proof goes to the authors.

The production team should take care to check the submission system prior to contacting the authors as sometimes there may be reasons it would be more appropriate to include this as an additional file, such as there being complex graphical components that cannot be rendered in an appendix section. Furthermore, the editorial team may have previously requested that the content be moved to an additional file and contradictory requests to the author should be avoided or explained.

### Corrupted files

During production of an article, it should be confirmed as far as possible that all addiitonal files are intact/valid documents. This should be done by downloading the file from the proof \(or staged article\) and seeing if there are any issues when it is opened in the appropriate program. ZIP packages should also be expanded to make sure they are complete. If a file is corrupted, check the submission system to see if this is true of the original and either replace the document with the uncorrupted version or go to the authors to request one.

Ideally this should be checked both prior and after the article is loaded to the journal website as conversions may occur at this stage. In the unlikely event that it appears the creation of the final package is responsible for the corruption of a file, the content processors should be advised and requested to resolve the issue.

Please note that there are going to be some additional files we cannot check as they are intended for use with propriatory software that we do not have access to. In these cases, there is unfortunately little we can do beyond making sure the files to not have an arbitrarily low size \(e.g. in the range of bytes rather than at least kilobytes\).

## Schematron checks

### Content checks

#### supplementary-material-test-2

**Warning**: _XXXXXX is missing a title/caption - is this correct? \(supplementary-material should have a child caption.\)_

**Action**: This warning indicates that an additional file does not have a title or legend. The author should be queried to provide one if possible.

* Please provide a descriptive title for this file.

If this is at the post-author stage, check whether the author was previously queried about this. If they provided a title, add this in. If not, please contact them and reiterate the request. Note that in the case of asset-level source data, it is acceptable to proceed without a title as the lable \(e.g. Figure 1—source data 1\) is largely descriptive of what the file contains.

#### pre-supplementary-material-test-3

**Warning**: _XXXXXX does not have a title._

**Action**:  This warning indicates that an additional file does not have a title or legend. The author should be queried to provide one:

* Please provide a descriptive title for this file.

**Action**: 

#### source-code-test-2

**Warning**: _Source code files should always be zipped. The file type for XXXXXX is 'XXXXXX'. Please zip this file, and replace it with the zipped version._

**Action**: 

#### back-supplementary-file-position

**Error**: _XXXXXX id ends with XXXXXX, but it is placed XXXXXX. Either it is mislabelled, the id is incorrect, or it should be moved to a different position._

**Action**: 

#### back-supplementary-file-id

**Error**: _The id \(XXXXXX\) for XXXXXX is not in the correct format. Supplementary files need to have ids in the format 'supp0'._

**Action**: 

#### back-source-data-position

**Error**: _XXXXXX id ends with XXXXXX, but it is placed XXXXXX. Either it is mislabelled, the id is incorrect, or it should be moved to a different position._

**Action**: 

#### fig-data-test-1

**Warning**: _XXXXXX is figure level source data, but contains 1 figure citation which is a link to a figure supplement - should it be figure supplement level source data?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the description for a source data file associated with a main figure contains a citation to a figure supplement. In cases where the source data title or legend mentions both the main figure and one or more figure supplements \(e.g. "Source data for Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1"\) this warning can be ignored. In cases where only a figure supplement is mentioned \(e.g. "Source data for Figure 4—figure supplement 1D"\) the source data should be moved so that it is associated with the cited figure supplement.

In cases where the source data title or legend mentions multiple figure supplements \(e.g. Source data for Figure 1–figure supplements 1–4"\) it is appropriate to leave it associated with the main figure \(Figure 1 in this example\) since it wouldn't be correct to associate it with any single figure supplement.

#### fig-code-test-1

**Warning**: _XXXXXX is figure level source code, but contains 1 figure citation which is a link to a figure supplement - should it be figure supplement level source code?_

**Action**: This warning indicates that the description for a source code file associated with a main figure contains a citation to a figure supplement. In cases where the source code title or legend mentions both the main figure and one or more figure supplements \(e.g. "Source code for Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1"\) this warning can be ignored. In cases where only a figure supplement is mentioned \(e.g. "Source code for Figure 4—figure supplement 1D"\) the source code should be moved so that it is associated with the cited figure supplement.

In cases where the source code title or legend mentions multiple figure supplements \(e.g. Source code for Figure 1–figure supplements 1–4"\) it is appropriate to leave it associated with the main figure \(Figure 1 in this example\) since it wouldn't be correct to associate it with any single figure supplement.
