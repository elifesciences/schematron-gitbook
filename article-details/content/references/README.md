# References

## Schematron warnings

The following rules apply to all references.

Add info about years \(a, b\) if two references are the same

### Content warnings

List of errors and warnings that can occur, with guidance on how to solve each problem or on when it is OK to let the warning go by and not change anything.

These warnings relate to the content of XXXXXX.

#### duplicate-ref-test-4

**Warning:** _ref 'XXXXXX' has the same title as another reference, but a different source. Is this correct? - 'XXXXXX'_

**Action:** This warning will appear if two references have the same titles. This may happen if the authors include two separate reference lists which have been collated into one, leaving duplicate references. Check the details of both references and if the information is exactly the same, delete one of the duplicates. If the other details of the references differ \(e.g. year, author list, where the article was published\), then both references should be kept. For example, this warning will fire if the two references below are in the same article. However, as the other details of the references differ, both should be kept in the reference list.
