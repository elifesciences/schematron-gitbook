# Impact statement

## What is an impact statement?

An impact statement is a succinct summary of an article, intended for display on the contents views of the eLife website:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-11-at-16.08.19.png)

Impact statements do not display on the main article page on the website or the PDF.

An impact statement should be a single complete sentence, no more than 30 words in length. Multiple sentences or multiple statements joined with semi-colons are not allowed. Colons are similarly not allowed, except when the article is a [Replication study](impact-statement.md#impact-statements-in-replication-studies). The statement should be properly punctuated and end in a full stop. Bold text is not allowed but italics and superscript should be retained as the author provides, and as in the title, species names \(e.g. _Homo sapiens_\) should be in italics.

The statement should not repeat the title and it should not be written in the first-person. It should not use acronyms without defining them, although commonly used terms \(such as RNA\) are OK. It should match the main text in terms of whether UK or US spelling is used.

## What needs to be checked?

Impact statements display with the Article details, just below the title:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-15.30.31.png)

Impact statements may need to be edited as follows:

* A full stop should be added to the end if missing.
* General spelling errors or missing spaces between words should be corrected.
* Italics should be applied to any species names if not already present.
* Any possessive phrases \('we show', 'this study shows' etc.\) should be removed or replaced with third-person alternatives.
* Excepting their use in scientific terms \(e.g. ratios 1:800\), if a colon or semi-colon is present, the statement should be rephrased \(unless the article is a Replication study, in which case the statement should begin 'Editors' summary:'\).
* Uncommon abbreviations should be spelled out per the article text.
* Brackets are not forbidden but should be removed if not required for clarity.
* If the statement repeats the article title at length, it should be rephrased to avoid this.

Whenever an impact statement is edited, the author must be notified using the following author query:

* The impact statement has been edited. Please confirm whether the revised wording is acceptable.

If the statement is longer than 30 words, it should be shortened if this is possible without changing the scientific meaning of the text. If it is unclear how to do this, the authors will need to be asked to shorten it themselves:

* Please rephrase this impact statement so that it is no more than 30 words in length.

In extreme cases, where it is not possible to create an acceptable impact statement from the text provided \(e.g. they have provided multiple sentences and  it is unclear how they should be combined\), the following query may be used to ask the authors to start again:

* The impact statement should be a single sentence that summarises the key findings of the work. Please provide a revised impact statement that clearly explains the main results of your study.

### Impact statements in Replication studies

For Replication studies, the impact statement is used as an 'Editors' Summary', giving the outcome of the replication of a previously published work. There are several variations on this summary that apply to different outcomes:

* Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced important parts of the original paper. 
* Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced some parts of the original paper but other parts could not be interpreted.
* Editors' Summary: This Replication Study has reproduced some parts of the original paper but it also contains results that are not consistent with other parts of the original paper.
* Editors' Summary: This Replication Study did not reproduce those experiments in the original paper that it attempted to reproduce.

The eLife Editorial team will ideally update the impact statement before the the article is exported for processing, but sometimes this will be delayed until the decision letter/author response has been edited. In these cases, the exported impact statement will need to be replaced with the finalised Editorsâ€™ Summary as soon as this is available \(usually at the point that the DL/AR are uploaded\). This will be done by the Production team.

## Examples

### Avoiding title repetition

An impact statement should not simply repeat the article title and it is generally preferred that they are clearly distinct from one another. In the following case, the statement for article "TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and promotes MyD88-dependent signaling in environmental lung injury" originally read:

> "TLR5 participates in the TLR4 signaling complex and modulates the response to TLR4 ligands in mice and humans."

So the first five words of both were the same, "TLR5 participates in the TLR4". To correct this, the order of words in the statement was switched around as follow:

> "The response to TLR4 ligands in mice and humans is modulated by TLR5, which participates in the TLR4 signaling complex."

### Bracket use

If brackets can be replaced with commas, this should be done. For example, the following impact statement uses them to enclose the name of an enzyme:

> "By combining structure-based computational predictions and a thorough structural analysis, a highly thermostable enzyme **\(alcohol dehydrogenase\)** has been engineered."

This can be corrected to the following without affecting the readability of the statement:

> "By combining structure-based computational predictions and a thorough structural analysis, a highly thermostable enzyme**, alcohol dehydrogenase,** has been engineered."

In the following instance, however, this kind of edit would be inappropriate as the statement reads clearer with the brackets in place:

> "Reprogramming of transcription factors by PRR-independent \(cAMP\) and PRR-dependent \(curdlan\) signaling induces new dendritic cell subset."

### Fragment correction

The following impact statement is an example of a fragment rather than a complete sentence:

> "Comprehensive compendium of myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system and method to address molecular diversity of myelin sheaths in health and disease."

This was edited so that rather than two descriptive phrases, it was formulated as a single proper sentence:

> "A comprehensive compendium of myelin proteins in the peripheral nervous system has been created, alongside a method to address molecular diversity of myelin sheaths in health and disease."

Similarly, this impact statement was also not a full sentence.

> "Calpain as a promising therapeutic target to reduce spasticity after a spinal cord injury."

This was easily fixed by simply changed 'as' to 'is'.

> "Calpain **is** a promising therapeutic target to reduce spasticity after a spinal cord injury."

### Removing possessive phrases

Impact statements must be written in the third person, so phrases such as 'we show' are not allowed. If they are present, the statement must be rewritten. For example, this following impact statement has 'we named . . .' in it:

> "A female fertility syndrome in _Drosophila_ called gonadal dysgenesis is caused by the _P_-transposase actively mobilizing a very short _P_-element variant **that we named** the _Har-P_."

This was therefore edited to read instead:

> "A female fertility syndrome in _Drosophila_ called gonadal dysgenesis is caused by the _P_-transposase actively mobilizing a very short _P_-element variant **that has been named** the _Har-P."_

### Semi-colon removal

Outside of their use in scientific terms, semi-colons are not allowed in impact statements.

> "Plasmodium uses host-derived factors to form more rosettes to hamper **phagocytosis;** a good example of host-parasite interaction in immunopathobiology."

This statement was edited to the following based on information given in the abstract:

> "Plasmodium parasites use host-derived factors to form more rosettes and hamper phagocytosis, representing a new escape mechanism for the malaria parasites."

### Spelling out abbreviations

The use of undefined abbreviations is discouraged, excepting commonly used ones such as DNA or protein/gene names. A general rule of thumb is that if the authors spell out the term in full in their abstract/main text, it should be given in full in the impact statement \(provided this does not take the statement over the 30 word limit. For example:

> "The tissue environment shapes the lipid recognition capacity of **NKT** cells."

Here, the expansion of 'NKT' was found from the abstract:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-03-17-at-15.08.05.png)

> "The tissue environment shapes the lipid recognition capacity of **natural killer T** cells."

If spelling out the abbreviation would take the statement over 30 words, it is acceptable to leave the abbreviation as it is, provided that the title of the article uses the spelled-out version. It is also acceptable to leave the abbreviations if the authors are defining it in their impact statement, e.g.

> "The human cytomegalovirus \(HCMV\) interactome systematically characterises high-confidence viral-viral and viral-host protein interactions in HCMV-infected cells, facilitating multiple novel insights into HCMV and herpesviral function."

### 'This study' removal

Simply referring to the work as 'a study' in the third person is fine, e.g.

> "A study of 3,500 children in the UK shows that data on socioeconomic background and previous educational achievements can better predict how students will perform at school than genetic data."

However, if phrases such as 'this study shows' or 'this work proves' are used, they will need to be edited. For example:

> "**This study formulates** quantitative, experimentally testable predictions allowing to discriminate between contraction mechanisms in disordered actomyosin and microtubule/motor bundles."

This was changed to the following:

> "Quantitative, experimentally testable predictions allow discrimination between contraction mechanisms in disordered actomyosin and microtubule/motor bundles."

A more subtle example of this can be seen in the following, where the authors do not refer directly to the work, but instead just say 'here':

> "Novel drug-binding sites of TRPC6 **identified here** could potentially facilitate future design of drugs to treat TRPC6-mediated diseases."

In this case, simply removing 'identified here' was sufficient to provide a correct statement:

> "Novel drug-binding sites of TRPC6 could potentially facilitate future design of drugs to treat TRPC6-mediated diseases."

## Schematron warnings

The following tests are run on impact statements.

### Content warnings

#### custom-meta-test-5

**Warning**: _Impact statement contains more than 30 words. This is not allowed._

**Action**: When an impact statement is more than 30 words in length, it should be shortened if this is possible without changing the scientific meaning of the text. If this is not possible, the author should be asked to rephrase it to bring it under the word limit:

* Please rephrase this impact statement so that it is no more than 30 words in length.

#### final-custom-meta-test-6

**Error**: _Impact statement must end with a full stop or question mark._

**Action**: add a full-stop to the end of the impact statement.

#### custom-meta-test-7

**Warning**: _Impact statement appears to be made up of more than one sentence. Please check, as more than one sentence is not allowed._

**Action**: If possible, rephrase the impact statement to combine the multiple sentences into one. If it is not clear how to do this, please query the authors:

* The impact statement should be a single sentence that summarises the key findings of the work. Please provide a revised impact statement that clearly explains the main results of your study.

#### custom-meta-test-8

**Warning**: _Impact statement contains a colon or semi-colon, which is likely incorrect. It needs to be a proper sentence._

**Action**: If possible, rephrase the impact statement to remove the need for a colon or semi-colon. See [above](impact-statement.md#semi-colon-removal). If it is not clear how to do this, please query the authors:

* The impact statement should be a single sentence that summarises the key findings of the work. Please provide a revised impact statement that clearly explains the main results of your study.

#### pre-custom-meta-test-9

**Warning**: _Impact statement contains a possessive phrase. This is not allowed_

**Action**: The impact statement should be rephrased to avoid using 'We show', 'We prove', 'This work shows' or any other similar phrase. See [above](impact-statement.md#removing-possessive-phrases). This is a warning at the pre-author stages.

#### final-custom-meta-test-9

**Error**: _Impact statement contains a possessive phrase. This is not allowed_

**Action**: The impact statement should be rephrased to avoid using 'We show', 'We prove', 'This work shows' or any other similar phrase. See [above](impact-statement.md#removing-possessive-phrases). This is an error at the post-author stages.

#### custom-meta-test-10

**Error**: _Impact statement is comprised entirely of numbers, which must be incorrect._

**Action**: If the impact statement has been provided as a string of numbers, the authors must be asked to provide a proper statement:

* The impact statement should be a single sentence that summarises the key findings of the work. Please provide a revised impact statement that clearly explains the main results of your study.

#### custom-meta-test-11

**Warning**: _Impact statement contains 'our'. Is this possessive language relating to the article or research itself \(which should be removed\)?_

**Action**: The impact statement should be rephrased to avoid using 'We show', 'Our work proves', 'This work shows' or any other similar phrase. See [above](impact-statement.md#removing-possessive-phrases).

#### custom-meta-test-13

**Warning**: _Impact statement contains 'study'. Is this a third person description of this article? If so, it should be changed to not include this._

**Action**: Check to see if the statement contains a phrase such as 'This study shows' or ' In this study'. If it does, the statement must be rephrased. See [above](impact-statement.md#this-study-removal).

#### pre-rep-study-custom-meta-test

**Warning**: _Impact statement in Replication studies must begin with 'Editors' summary: '. This does not - 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: XXXXXX will be the current impact statement. In replication studies, impact statements act as a summary of the editorâ€™s assessment of how successful the work was in replicating the previous work. The text must begin 'Editors' summary: ' \(see [above](impact-statement.md#impact-statements-in-replication-studies)\). If this has been misspelled, please correct it. If this prefix is not present, please alert the Production team so that they can get the correct text from the Editorial team. The article should not go to the authors until this is resolved, but can be moved to waiting for assets. This is a warning at the pre-author stages. 

#### final-rep-study-custom-meta-test

**Error**: _Impact statement in Replication studies must begin with 'Editors' summary: '. This does not - 'XXXXXX'_

**Action**: XXXXXX will be the current impact statement. In replication studies, impact statements act as a summary of the editorâ€™s assessment of how successful the work was in replicating the previous work. The text must begin 'Editors' summary: ' \(see [above](impact-statement.md#impact-statements-in-replication-studies)\). If this has been misspelled, please correct it. If this prefix is not present, the Production team will need to check with the Editorial team to get the correct text for the impact statement. This is an error at the pre-author stages.

#### custom-meta-child-test-1

**Error**: _&lt;XXX&gt; is not allowed in impact statement._

**Action**: `<XXX>` will be a disallowed XML element\(s\) currently present in the impact statement. The only XML elements allowed within the impact statement are `<italic>`, `<sup>` or `<sub>`. To address this warning, remove any formatting that is not italic, superscript or subscript, and remove any hyperlinks. For example, if the warning reads "&lt;bold&gt; is not allowed in impact statement", bold formatting is present and should be removed; similarly, "&lt;ext-link&gt; is not allowed in impact statement" indicates a hyperlink.

#### insight-asbtract-impact-test-1

**Warning**: _In insights, abstracts must be the same as impact statements. Here the abstract reads "XXXXXX", whereas the impact statement reads "XXXXXX"._

**Action**: As this warning states, the impact statements in an Insight article should match exactly to the abstract. The eLife Features team will need to be alerted when this is not the case so that they can make a decision about which text is correct.

#### insight-asbtract-impact-test-2	

**Warning**: _In insights, abstracts must be the same as impact statements. Here the abstract has XXXXXX child element\(s\), whereas the impact statement has XXXXXX child element\(s\). Check for possible missing formatting._

**Action**: The impact statements in an Insight article should match exactly to the abstract. This warning will fire if there are different numbers of child elements in the abstract and impact statement, indicating that there may be different formatting in the two places. Update the text so that the formatting is consistent - species names should be placed in italics, bold formatting should be removed. The eLife Features team should be queried if it is unclear which style is correct.

### XML structure warnings

These tests check the underlying structure of the [XML](impact-statement.md#xml-structure) for impact statements. Resolving these may require the intervention of technical support.

#### custom-meta-test-1

**Error**: _One meta-name must be present in custom-meta._

**Action**: This rule will only fire for research content, where one `<custom-meta>` elements should be present in `<custom-meta-group>`, containing one `<meta-name>` element and one `<meta-value>` element. If this rule fires, either there are no `<meta-name>` elements present, or there is there is more than one. Ensure that one `<meta-name>`element is present in the XML. Remove any extra elements of this type.

#### custom-meta-test-2

**Error**: _The value of meta-name can only be 'Author impact statement'. Currently it is 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: XXXXXX will be the current value of `<meta-name>`. This rule will only fire for research content, when the contents of `<meta-name>` are not 'Author impact statement'. Correct the value within the `<meta-name>` element so that it is 'Author impact statement'.

#### custom-meta-test-3

**Error**: _One meta-value must be present in custom-meta._

**Action**: For each instance of `<custom-meta>` in the [XML](impact-statement.md#xml-structure), there should be one and only one `<meta-value>` element. Ensure this is the case and remove extra elements of this type.

#### custom-meta-test-14

**Error**: _The value of the 1st meta-name can only be 'Author impact statement'. Currently it is 'XXXXXX'._

**Action**: XXXXXX will be the current value of the first `<meta-name>` element. This rule will only fire for feature content when the contents of the first `<meta-name>` are not 'Author impact statement'. Correct the value within the first `<meta-name>` in `<custom-meta>` element so that it is 'Author impact statement'.

#### custom-meta-test-15

**Error**: _The value of the 2nd meta-name can only be 'Template'. Currently it is 'XXXXX'._

**Action**: XXXXXX will be the current value of the 2nd `<meta-name>` element. This rule will only fire for feature content when the contents of the second `<meta-name>` are not 'Template'. Correct the value within the second `<meta-name>` in `<custom-meta>` element so that it is 'Template'.

#### custom-meta-test-4

**Error**: _The value of meta-value cannot be empty_

**Action**: If a `<meta-value>` element is present in the XML, it must contain some content. This should contain the text for the impact statement \(see [below](impact-statement.md#xml-structure)\). If this error fires, check that an impact statement is present. If it is, this problem will likely require intervention from technical support to fix the XML conversion. If there is no impact statement, the Production team will need to be alerted so they can check the submitted article details. In the event of an export bug, they should provide the submitted impact statement that should be entered. In the unlikely event that no statement was provided in the first place, the author should be queried:

* The impact statement should be a single sentence that summarises the key findings of the work. Please provide a revised impact statement that clearly explains the main results of your study.
