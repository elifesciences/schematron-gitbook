# Feature content

## What is Feature content?

At eLife, the term 'Feature content' covers all non-research content published by the journal. This is synonymous with 'Magazine content' and can be found under this heading on the eLife website: [https://elifesciences.org/magazine](https://elifesciences.org/magazine).

This content is overseen by the Features team and consists in part of blogposts and [podcasts](https://elifesciences.org/podcast) that do not required Production intervention to publish. Digests are also published in a dedicated [section](https://elifesciences.org/digests) under the magazine heading, in addition to being included in the related article.

In addition to this, however, there are four categories of Feature article that come through the Production process:

* **Insight** - a commentary article accompanying one or more research articles, usually written by the editors or reviewers who worked on the article, providing context for a broader audience and discussing the importance of the findings being reported.
* **Editorial** - an editorial piece written by one or more of eLife's deputy or senior editors, or the editor-in-chief, usually addressing a specific issue or development in the scientific community and/or eLife in particular.
* **Feature contribution** - an article that is not reporting any scientific findings but instead offers a perspective or comment on events, issues or developments in the scientific community.
* **Feature research** - an article that reports the results of meta-research; that is, studies carried out on the research community and its practices - research on how research is done. 

### Feature templates

There are five Feature templates that map to the above article types. Aside from differences in the content of the articles, these reflect different PDF layouts.

| Template number | Article type | PDF format | Possible content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Template 1 | Insight | Two column, with key information box on first page; one-sentence abstract displayed as stand-first | Labelled figures, no digest, no decision/response, no editors/reviewers, no funding, no data availability |
| Template 2 | Editorial | Two column, one-sentence abstract displayed as stand-first | Illustrations, no digest, pull-quotes, no decision/response, no editors/reviewers, no funding, no data availability |
| Template 3 | Feature contribution | Two column, one-sentence abstract displayed as stand-first | Illustrations, no digest, pull-quotes, no decision/response, no editors/reviewers, no funding, no data availability |
| Template 4 | Feature contribution | Two column, full abstract | Labelled figures, tables, boxes, no digest, pull-quotes, no decision/response, no editors/reviewers, no funding, no data availability |
| Template 5 | Feature research | Two column, full abstract | Labelled figures, tables, boxes, no digest, possible decision/response, editors/reviewers, funding information, data availability section |

The template for each Feature article will be indicated using the article file name in the exported files, for example "elife50543\_template3.docx" or "elife46563\_template4.docx".

### Unique features of Feature content

Feature content includes the following items not found in research content:

* **Title prefix** - a brief category label displayed in front of the title, currently captured in the XML as a 'sub-display-channel' subject element. Text is given in title case.

* **Author bio** - a short description of the author's affiliation and any notable positions held. This is given in addition to author affiliations, rather than replacing them, but supercedes them for display.

* **Illustrations** - unlabelled figures with a single sentence description. May also include an attribution.

* **Key info box** - in Insights specifically, the details of the article\(s\) being commented upon are given in a box on the first page of the PDF. This content is not currently displayed online.

* **Pull-quotes** - in Templates 2-4, pull-quotes can be used to highlight key points in the text.

## Submission and export of Feature content

Feature content is submitted to eLife via two paths: articles submitted via the the normal submission process and articles commissioned or invited by the Feature team. When articles are submitted via the normal process, they will go through peer review, usually overseen by the Features Editors, and likely have decision and response sections. Commissioned articles are not reviewed and so will have no editors or review materials associated with them. These will be uploaded to the submissions system by the Features team, who will use the 'auto-accept' option to bypass the reviewing process.

In both cases, the Features team will carry out checks and editing tasks before the articles are exported for production. Part of this involves formatting the article files using 'pseudo-tagging' to designate the various parts of the content for processing. If the article needs to be published as an accepted manuscript \(PoA\), then this will need to be done before these changes are made to ensure a clean accepted manuscript is published. When the PoA process has been carried out, the article should be held in the export queue until the pseudo-tagging has been added.

![Example of pseudo tagging in the article file for an Editorial](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-01-at-17.47.09.png)

The article file will also be renamed to indicate which template should be used and will rename any figure files to indicate the width at which they should be placed in the PDF. Since Feature content uses a two-column PDF template, there are more options for figure placement than in Research content. These are described using the following classes:

* **Class A** = 1 column wide
* **Class B** = 1 column plus the margin wide
* **Class C** = 2 columns wide
* **Class D** = 2 columns plus the margin wide \(i.e. full page\)

The class chosen for each figure will be indicated in the file name.

Once the files have been edited, the article will be exported. At this point, the Features team may contact the Production team by email to advise them whether a decision/response will be included, or any unusual elements such as complex boxes, or to give a specific deadline for getting the proof to the authors.

## Production process for Feature content

### Pre-editing

Feature content should be processed as soon as possible after export \(within 24 hours for Insights, Editorials and Template 3/4 content, within 48 hours for Template 5 content\). If more time is required, the content processors should let the Production team know as soon as possible.

No copy-editing should be required for Feature content as this will already have been carried out by the Feature team prior to export. In very rare cases where external copy-editing is required, the Features team will advise the Production team who will request that the article is moved into the external copy-editing workflow.

Once a feature article has been processed, it will be moved to the pre-author check stage to allow the Production team to check the content prior to author proofing.

### Pre-author check

The Production team will check Feature content before it goes out to the author to ensure that it has been processed correctly, and to make sure any special requirements have been fulfilled. In order to do this, it will be necessary to open the article in the submission system to compare against the processed version.

#### Title prefix

The title prefix is displayed as the 'sub display channel' in the article details page. This should be in title case \(as opposed to the sentence case used for all other eLife headings\).

#### Author bio

The author bio displays under the author name and can be edited in the author details panel.

![Author bio display](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-30-at-15.47.55.png)

Each author should be assigned the same affiliations that are described in the bio. Note that these do not have to be exactly the same. For example, an affiliation may be described as "" but would be entered as two affiliations, "" and "".

The author's name should be given in bold and the bio should not end in a full-stop.

#### Key info box

In Insight articles, a key info box will be displayed at the start of the Content page, just below the Abstract. It should contain the details of the related research article\(s\), with the DOI hyperlinked to the correct page.
