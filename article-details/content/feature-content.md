# Feature content

## What is Feature content?

At eLife, the term 'Feature content' covers all non-research content published by the journal. This is synonymous with 'Magazine content' and can be found under this heading on the eLife website: [https://elifesciences.org/magazine](https://elifesciences.org/magazine).

This content is overseen by the Features team and consists in part of blogposts and [podcasts](https://elifesciences.org/podcast) that do not required Production intervention to publish. Digests are also published in a dedicated [section](https://elifesciences.org/digests) under the magazine heading, in addition to being included in the related article.

In addition to this, however, there are four categories of Feature article that come through the Production process:

* **Insight** - a commentary article accompanying one or more research articles, usually written by the editors or reviewers who worked on the article, providing context for a broader audience and discussing the importance of the findings being reported.
* **Editorial** - an editorial piece written by one or more of eLife's deputy or senior editors, or the editor-in-chief, usually addressing a specific issue or development in the scientific community and/or eLife in particular.
* **Feature contribution** - an article that is not reporting any scientific findings but instead offers a perspective or comment on events, issues or developments in the scientific community.
* **Feature research** - an article that reports the results of meta-research; that is, studies carried out on the research community and its practices - research on how research is done. 

### Feature templates

There are five Feature templates that map to the above article types. Aside from differences in the content of the articles, these reflect different PDF layouts.
