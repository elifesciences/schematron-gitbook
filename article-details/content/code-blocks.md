# Code blocks

## What are code blocks?

Authors will sometimes include snippets of code in their articles. This is usually either to illustrate the computational methods that they have used in their work or to provide user guidance to allow readers to replicate that work. Since the exact layout of code is usually important, this needs to be preserved using a 'code block'.

Within a code block, the text is rendered in a monospace font and the spacing and line-breaks are preserved.
