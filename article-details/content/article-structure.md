# Article structure

## What is article structure?

Article structure refers to the headings and sections into which the main text is organised. eLife currently allows four levels of headings:

* **Level 1** - top level heading that will appear within the jump-to menu on the published HTML view:

![Level 1 &apos;Introduction&apos; heading in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.45.13.png)

![Level 1 &apos;Introduction&apos; heading in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.49.07.png)

* **Level 2** - sub-section heading under a Level 1 heading:

![Level 2 heading &apos;Glycan synthesis in Golgi compartments&apos; heading in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.51.12.png)

![Level 2 heading &apos;Glycan synthesis in Golgi compartments&apos; heading in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.51.30.png)

* **Level 3** - sub-section heading under a Level 2 heading:

![Level 3 heading &apos;Promiscuity&apos; in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.53.45.png)

![Level 3 heading &apos;Promiscuity&apos; in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.53.21.png)

* **Level 4** - sub-section heading under a Level 3 heading.



Any number of Level 2, 3 or 4 headings may appear within their parent sections. However, eLife limits the number of Level 1 headings in research content to between one and four in most cases.
