# Article structure

## What is article structure?

Article structure refers to the headings and sections into which the main text is organised. eLife currently allows four levels of headings:

* **Level 1** - top level heading that will appear within the jump-to menu on the published HTML view:

![Level 1 &apos;Introduction&apos; heading in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.45.13.png)

![Level 1 &apos;Introduction&apos; heading in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.49.07.png)

* **Level 2** - sub-section heading under a Level 1 heading:

![Level 2 heading &apos;Glycan synthesis in Golgi compartments&apos; heading in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.51.12.png)

![Level 2 heading &apos;Glycan synthesis in Golgi compartments&apos; heading in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.51.30.png)

* **Level 3** - sub-section heading under a Level 2 heading:

![Level 3 heading &apos;Promiscuity&apos; in online view](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.53.45.png)

![Level 3 heading &apos;Promiscuity&apos; in PDF](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-14-at-16.53.21.png)

* **Level 4** - sub-section heading under a Level 3 heading.



Any number of Level 2, 3 or 4 headings may appear within their parent sections. However, eLife limits the number of Level 1 headings in research content to between one and four in most cases.

## Allowed article structures

The following are the allowed top-level structures for various different article types. These lists cover Level 1 headings only. There are no rules concerning heading levels 2â€“4 within these Level 1 sections.

### Research article

The usual structure for a research article is:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**
  * **Materials and methods**

A common variant of this is a combined results and discussion section:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Results and discussion**
  * **Materials and methods**

Occasionally, the editors will allow the authors to place their materials and methods before the results, where this is appropriate \(this is a common structure in life sciences articles\):

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Materials and methods**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**

In other cases, if an article is more methodological rather than experimental, 'Methods' may be substituted for 'Materials and methods'. Please note that authors often just put 'Methods' in their article file and in most cases this needs to be changed to the standard heading. Where 'Methods' should be retained, a production note indicating this will be left by Editorial.

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Methods**
  * **Results**

    **Discussion**

Finally, for modelling articles, the following structure is allowed. This should be more commonly used in tools and resources articles.

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Model**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**

### Research advance

Research advances share the same structure rules as research articles.

### Short report

Short reports may follow the standard research article structure:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**
  * **Materials and methods**

However, they are not required to do so. The bulk of the text can be placed in an untitled section at the start of the article, with a materials and methods section at the end.

* Main text
  * **Materials and methods**

Materials and methods is the only mandatory top-level section for short reports.

### Tools and resources

Tools and resources articles may follow the standard research article structure:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**
  * **Materials and methods**

However, since this article type can be used to describe models, the following structure is also permitted:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Model**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**

### Registered report

Registered reports will have the following article structure:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Materials and methods**

### Replication study

Replication studies share the same structure rules as research articles.

### Scientific correspondence

Scientific correspondence articles may follow the standard research article structure:

* Main text
  * **Introduction**
  * **Results**
  * **Discussion**
  * **Materials and methods**

 However, this is not mandated and other Level 1 headings are permitted. The article structure should follow that indicated in the exported article file.

### Review article

There are no preset rules for Level 1 headings in review articles. The article structure should follow that indicated in the exported article file.

### Feature content

There are no preset rules for Level 1 headings in feature content. The article structure should follow that indicated in the exported article file.
