# Name change requests

## What does this page cover?

When an individual changes their name \(through marriage, by deed-poll, as a result of transitioning to another gender etc.\), they may wish to update their articles in the scientific record to ensure that their work can be found under their new name.

eLife aims to allow authors, reviewers and editors to update their names with a minimum of hassle.

## Editorial process

### Initial request



### Confirmation



### Editorial approval



## Production process

Once the name change request has been approved by the Editorial team, they will supply a list of the affected content to the Production team. It will be Production's responsibility to ensure that all versions of this content are updated with the individual's new name. This will cover the following:

* The current version of the article
* Any previously published versions \(PoA, VoR\)
* Any related content such as Insights, Corrections or co-submissions
* Any pending versions of the article \(VoR, new versions\) in the proofing system

### Updating the current version of the article

The current version of each affected article should be silently corrected following the normal process. The individual's name should be changed in the following places where applicable:

* Article metadata:
  * author list or peer review details
  * author contributions
  * competing interests
  * funding table \(should correct automatically\)
  * funding statement
  * data statement
* Article content:
  * acknowledgements
  * decision letter
  * author response

In cases where the individual's pronouns have changed in addition to their name, the following sections should be checked and updated if necessary:

* competing interests
* funding statement
* acknowledgments



### Extracting old versions from the archive
