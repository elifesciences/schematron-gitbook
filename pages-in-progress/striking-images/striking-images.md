# Striking images

## **What is a striking image?** 

To maximise the impact of an article upon its release, it is beneficial to accompany an article with an eye catching image that highlights the research article. At eLife, when an acceptance letter is sent out, we encourage authors to submit a promotional image which we call a 'striking image' to the Production team and during their submission to eJP.

It is important to know that when authors send these images to us, they may refer to them in other ways. Other journals include promotional images and use them in different ways, such as: 

* **Cover images** - These are used as front cover images on the article's journal issue. 
* **Graphical abstracts** - A single, visual summative which explains the key findings of the study. Authors can use a relevant figure for this from the article or create a new image.  Please see below for an example.

### **Uses for striking images**

Striking images can be used as 

* a homepage image \[see [**here**](https://elifesciences.org/archive/2020) for the homepage archive\]
* within the eLife digest \[see [**here**](https://elifesciences.org/digests) for the digest channel\] 
* to promote the article via social media channels \[see [**here**](https://twitter.com/eLife/status/1278358999386259457) for an example on Twitter\]

The authors are also free to use these images for their own social media and press releases and do not need to ask permission for this. 

### **Requirements** 

These images should preferably be in colour, in a landscape format and we at least 1800 x 900 pixels. Photographs, microscopy images and illustrations work best. PNG, TIFF, or JPEG formats are preferred, and we must be able to use the image under the terms of the CC-BY license. Though we request these specifications, some flexibility should be given unless there are significant issues such as the image being too small to use. If this is the case, we can contact the author to provide a revised figure if they are able to.

### Uploading a striking image 

Authors can email Production with a striking image via email as indicated in the acceptance email from Editorial and will have been provided with the guidance shown below.

They may only include the title of the article without the article number but you can often find this by searching in eJP using the article title or email address of the author. If you are unable to do so, the author will need to be asked for this so that we can ensure the striking image is uploaded correctly. 

Depending on the status of the article, you can upload this striking image through eJP or the Kriya dashboard. 

### **Uploading via eJP** 

To upload this via eJP, you should bring up the accepted version of the article. Ensure this article has not already been exported from eJP to Kriya. To check, you can look to see if under  'More Manuscript Info and Tools' on the right hand side of the page, and see if the 'Export to Exeter' option is not displaying but instead says 'resent to Exeter'. Alternatively, you can look in the Production inbox for the XML notification.  

 Once you are sure that the article has not yet been exported, click 'Modify Manuscript Files' under the 'More Manuscript Info and Tools' menu. This will bring up the file list as shown below.  

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-02-at-13.58.59.png)

You can drag and drop the striking image into this field and it will automatically load to the bottom of the list. You should scroll down and click 'Upload files'.

Once this has been uploaded, you will be presented with a drop down menu to select the file type. Please select 'Potential Striking Image'. This will then bring up a title and legend box that can be filled in. The authors may not provide a title so you can leave this as 'Potential Striking Image' but if any caption or image credit has been included in the email, ensure this is added to the legend and click save.

### Uploading via Kriya 



Give specific examples of everything that needs to be checked/any common problems. Add sub-sections where needed, but be as succinct as possible. Include screenshots as required.

This section should also list any issues that can be spotted without the need to run Schematron tests such as low figure quality, broken paragraphs, badly formatted tables etc. Crosscheck against the protocol documents in this folder.

Any quotes from articles should be formatted as quotes

Any Kriya queries should be formatted as a bullet point

Any hyperlinks to other pages or websites should be bolded to make sure they are more visible. 

Schematron checks

Content checks
