# Fixing Crossref/Dryad failures

## What is Crossref? 

Crossref is most commonly know for providing Digital Object Identifiers \(DOIs\) for research outputs making them easier to locate, cite, and more. DOIs allow the reader to follow a stable link straight to the content even when a website has changed. Each publisher will have their own ID in the DOI and this is followed by a slash and a string of numbers that are unique to the content. 

Here is an example of an eLife DOI: 10.7554/eLife.58603

At eLife, when an article is PoAed, the DOI is submitted automatically to Crossref and once processed, it will be registered with them. This is also triggered when a VOR article is ready for publication and sent to Continuum. If it has a date in the future ,say for press, the DOI will then be registered on the day of publication.  

## Crossref emails

Production receive Crossref emails for both PoA and VOR articles that are sent for publication on Continuum.

## What to do when a failure occurs 





Outline the main things that need to be checked. Include a checklist if possible.

Examples

Give specific examples of everything that needs to be checked/any common problems. Add sub-sections where needed, but be as succinct as possible. Include screenshots as required.

This section should also list any issues that can be spotted without the need to run Schematron tests such as low figure quality, broken paragraphs, badly formatted tables etc. Crosscheck against the protocol documents in this folder.

Any quotes from articles should be formatted as quotes

Any Kriya queries should be formatted as a bullet point

Any hyperlinks to other pages or websites should be bolded to make sure they are more visible. 

Schematron checks

Content checks
