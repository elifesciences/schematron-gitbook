# eTOC

Twice a week an email is sent out to subscribers listing all the articles eLife has published in a certain time period.

The eTOC is sent every Monday and Wednesday.

The email subject is 'New articles from eLife â€“ {date}'.

The cutoff for papers to be included is midnight the night before the eTOC is sent \(so Monday's eTOC includes anything published up until 11.59 on Sunday night, and not included in the previous Wednesday's eTOC\).

On occasion, authors may contact production to ask why their article did not appear in an eTOC. It will likely be a timing issue. If their article was published at 4PM on Monday, it would not appear in Monday's eTOC, but instead on Wednesday's.

The eTOC is generated using `search` \(which also powers the listings of content on the website\). If there are unexplained issues \(such as an article not appearing in the expected eTOC\), it may indicate that there is an issue with `search` and that the dev team would need to investigate.

At time of writing, Will Hayes in the communications team is the point of contact for anything eTOC related.
