# Homepage images

## What are homepage images?

On eLife's [**homepage**](https://elifesciences.org/), we feature three [**striking images**](./) on an image carousel. Each image will stay on the carousel for three weeks, which is great promotion for the article.

## What makes a great homepage image?

When looking through the possible striking images, it is important to keep in mind that the image will be in landscape orientation with white text overlaying the image. The image should have a strong visual impact and ideally not contain more than one panel. As mentioned in the striking image [**guidance**](./#requirements), there should be no graphs, text, or summary figures. The best choices are colour photographs, microscopy images and illustrations. It is also good practise to look at the other two images on the carousel and try to vary the theme of the images if you can. 

## Examples

Below are some of the images that have featured on the homepage.

## The homepage image process 

The homepage image is selected by a nominated member of the Production team on a Monday morning and this image will be emailed to Peter \(on the Features team\) to provide the wording which overlays the image. This text is a short description of the article which you can see on the carousel at the top of this page.

To ensure this is not forgotten, a reminder email is sent to the Production inbox.

There will be a homepage image email thread for the month, typically in the format 'Homepages for August'.
