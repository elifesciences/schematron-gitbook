# Homepage images

## What are homepage images?

On eLife's [**homepage**](https://elifesciences.org/), we feature three [**striking images**](./) on an image carousel. Each image will stay on the carousel for three weeks, which is great promotion for the article.

## What makes a good homepage image?

## Selecting a homepage image

The homepage image is selected by a nominated member of the Production team on a Monday morning and this image will be sent to Peter \(on the Features team\) to provide the overlaying text. This text is a short description of the article which you can see on the carousel above.

To ensure this is not forgotten, a reminder email is sent to the Production inbox.

There will be a homepage image email thread for the month, typically in the format 'Homepages for August'. 

Examples

Give specific examples of everything that needs to be checked/any common problems. Add sub-sections where needed, but be as succinct as possible. Include screenshots as required.

This section should also list any issues that can be spotted without the need to run Schematron tests such as low figure quality, broken paragraphs, badly formatted tables etc. Crosscheck against the protocol documents in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2wDI5EMHiJ-UzctZnVBdWFwbzA).

> Any quotes from articles should be formatted as quotes

* Any Kriya queries should be formatted as a bullet point

Any [**hyperlinks**](../../untitled-4.md) to other pages or websites should be bolded to make sure they are more visible.
