# Toggl

## What is Toggl?

[**Toggl**](https://toggl.com/) is a time-tracking application that the eLife production team uses to monitor how much time is spent on different tasks. This information will be used to monitor the effect of changes to workflows, to track the distribution of work compared to article volumes, to double-check the team has time to work on projects outside the day-to-day tasks, and so on.

The Toggl interface works on self-reporting, with the user required to start and stop the time like a stop-watch. The user can add a manual description of the task, assign it to a preset ‘project’ and add one or more preset tags.

## **Emails** 

When handling emails, you should always use the ‘Emails’ project unless they are related to striking images which should then go under the ‘Home page image/striking images’ project.

![](../.gitbook/assets/0%20%283%29.png)

If you are just looking at/closing standard emails \(such as Crossref emails, Exeter delivery updates etc\), you can track this under the ‘Emails’ project and leave the description blank or type ‘Emails’ into this.

We like to track how long emails take for particular articles so if you are replying to the authors, please add the manuscript number to the description field e.g. 58556.

## **Kriya dashboard**

To help us monitor the performance of the Kriya dashboard, it is helpful to track the time it takes to refresh the page or when assigning the articles to yourself.

![](../.gitbook/assets/1%20%282%29.png)

## **Pub check and Pub review**

We have these as separate projects so that we can monitor how long it takes to complete the pub check or pub review. This should be tracked from when you open the proof to when you sign off out of the proof. For Toggl, you should add the article number to the description.

![](../.gitbook/assets/2%20%282%29.png)

## **Continuum Checks**

As with the pub checks and reviews, we also track how long a Continuum check may take. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/3%20%282%29.png)

## **Meetings**

It is useful to track our meetings too, somethings these can overrun and it's easy to wonder where the day went!

![](../.gitbook/assets/4%20%282%29.png)

## **Training**

Unfortunately we are unable to track training that you may receive at the same time as another project \(such as being talked through an issue within your pub review\) so we have a training project for time that is solely dedicated to a training session.

![](../.gitbook/assets/5%20%281%29.png)

## **Slack**

If you are just using slack \(such as answering a query from Exeter or chatting to the Production team\), this should be tracked using the ‘Slack’ project. You do not need to add a description for this.

![](../.gitbook/assets/6%20%282%29.png)

## **Breaks/Lunch Break**

For completeness, it is useful to add these in for a better understanding of your day. Production uses a separate project for each of these but feel free to use the way that Prepress uses to track these.

## **Resupply**

Occasionally, you will have to resupply an article you were viewing on Continuum to correct an issue. Again, it is useful to track the time this takes on the Kriya dashboard - this may change to the dashboard project once we review our Toggl categories. You should add the article number to the description.
