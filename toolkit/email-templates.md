# Email templates

## Emails sent by the journal

The following automated emails are sent by the eLife bot:

* PoA publication
* VoR Publication
* Related Insight Publication
* Feature Publication

They are all sent from production@elifesciences.org. Emails are sent to every author in the article. The authors emails are taken from eJP outputs \(because non-corresponding author emails are not included in the data for an article\).

The email templates are all defined at [**https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-email-templates**](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-email-templates), and can be edited, as necessary, so that the correct information is included.

### PoA emails

The subject of this email is:

> The accepted version of your eLife article has been published: {doi} {article-title}



## Emails sent by Vendor systems

Automated emails sent during proofing \(such as proofing emails, and chaser emails\) are templated by the vendor's Production system. In order to change the content of these emails, a request will need to be raised for the developers of that system to enact the required changes.
