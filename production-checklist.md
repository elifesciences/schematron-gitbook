### Assigning articles 

### Article details checks 

#### Title 

* Check that the title makes sense.
* Only italic formatting is allowed.
* Check that it avoids unexplained acronyms. 
* For latin words, the general rule is that genes, bacteria and species such as ‘S. pombe’ should be italicised, and that phrases such as ‘in vivo’ or ‘in vitro’ should not be italicised. However continuity between the title, impact statement and article content is most important, so please check that italics are consistent.
