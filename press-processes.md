# Press processes

## What is press content? 

In the event that a paper has potentially broad public significance, authors may consider a press release. To coordinate this, they may discuss this with their institutional press officer and then get in touch with eLife directly, or they may be contacted by eLife's Media Relations Manager, Emily Packer. Both PoA and VoR articles can be associated with a press release, which will be written prior to publication, either in-house at eLife, by a freelance writer, or by the author's institution. You can find examples of eLife \(or freelance\)-written press packs ****[**here**](https://elifesciences.org/for-the-press). Press articles at eLife are almost always scheduled for Tuesday publication, but if authors insist on a different press publication date, this might be accommodated. Press content must be prioritised by both the content processors and the Production team. The Production team has a weekly meeting with Emily to schedule and to track the progress of upcoming press articles. 

## Press meetings 

Press meetings usually occur on a Thursday morning, and are attended by a member of the Production team and Emily. The meeting is an opportunity to confirm scheduled articles, check articles in progress, and estimate press dates for upcoming articles. These three stages will be covered below. 

### Confirm scheduled articles 

Before the meeting starts, the representative from Production needs to ensure that both Kriya 1 and Kriya 2 are refreshed and that they have the [**digest tracker**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Llag-aEnbuARu5ORDJFki4K73xzy1fz2B2XG_QHQPI/edit#gid=1376331906) ****and ****[**actions sheet**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWMKdmcl4i7EC_bHvrbpBcUKoXuMQ4WfrVDJ1HxQ0cc/edit?ts=56dd55b5) open in another tab. They start by running through all the articles marked as scheduled on the actions sheet, starting with the PoAs and then moving on to the VoRs. 

![PoAs scheduled on the actions sheet](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-24-at-15.51.54%20%281%29.png)

### Check articles in progress

They should then move over to Kriya and filter only for press articles, running through the articles in chronological order by press date \(unfortunately, Kriya does not order them chronologically\). In Kriya 1, you do this by selecting 'With Press Date' under 'Total'.  

![Kriya 1 dashboard filtered for &apos;With Press Date&apos; ](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-30-at-09.13.15.png)

In Kriya 2, this can be done by selecting the list view and ticking 'Yes' under the 'Press release date' filter. 

![Kriya 2 dashboard in list view filtered for &apos;Press release date&apos;](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-30-at-10.30.08.png)

When checking the status of press articles, if any of those marked for next Tuesday are still at the Author Review stage, they may not need to be pushed back at this point, and Emily can be updated on these in the [**Press Update email**](press-processes.md#press-update-email) ****on Monday. In the case that we have already corresponded with the authors and they have requested extensive edits and/or second round of review, it may be more appropriate to push the press date to the following Tuesday. 

### Estimate press dates for upcoming articles

Emily will then enquire about the status of potential press articles. To come up with a press date, you can consult the due dates for each article by clicking the 'detailed' section on Kriya 1 \(the calendar icon the top right hand corner of the panel\).

![&apos;Detailed&apos; section on Kriya 1](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-30-at-09.17.19.png)

If an article has been marked as getting a digest, you should refer to the [**digest tracker**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Llag-aEnbuARu5ORDJFki4K73xzy1fz2B2XG_QHQPI/edit#gid=1376331906) ****which will give you a due date for the digest. 

![Digest tracker displaying the due dates for digests](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-30-at-09.38.57.png)

If the article is due to reach Author Review on either a Monday or a Tuesday, then it can be scheduled for the following Tuesday. If it's due to go out to the author later in the week, it should be scheduled for the following Tuesday. For instance, in the screenshot above, the proof goes out to the authors on a Wednesday \(7th July\), so should be scheduled for the next week's Tuesday \(20th July\). You will need to allow more time, however, if there has been communication with the author that indicates a delay. Sometimes co-publishing VoRs will be press-released. In this case, when providing Emily with a date, you should consult both  If the article in question has not yet reached Kriya, Emily will make a note to check this in next week's meeting. 

### Marking articles as press in Kriya 

Emily will supply you with a date and time for a prospective press article. The times vary from article to article, usually due to the corresponding authors institutional time zone. Press articles can be marked in Kriya 2 by clicking on the relevant article and then the pen and paper icon next to 'Press Release Date'. You can then choose a date and time. You must specify whether this date is confirmed by selecting from the drop-down menu next to 'Confirmed'. 

![Scheduling a press article on Kriya 2](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-24-at-15.54.34%20%281%29.png)

On Kriya 1, press articles can be scheduled by clicking the press icon and choosing a date. A pop up will then prompt you to specify whether this date is confirmed.

## Continuum workflow for press articles 

Sometimes the VoR will catch up with a press-released PoA, and instead the former will take its place for the press release. If this is expected to be the case, Emily does not need to be notified. Before sending the VoR through to Continuum, you do need to un-schedule the PoA. To do this, you locate the relevant article, then press the 'cancel' button. 

![PoA article scheduled on Continuum](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-16.15.04.png)

The VoR can then be sent through to Continuum and scheduled as usual. This is done by locating the relevant article on the dashboard and clicking the 'schedule' button. You will then have the option to select the date and time, after which you click 'schedule'. The article should then be visible under the 'scheduled' tab on the dashboard.

## Press correspondence 

### Press enquiries 

Emails arriving in the Production inbox which relate to press content must be categorised as such using the 'Press' Hiver tag. When authors enquire about press, Emily should be copied into the response using the template shown below. It is advisable to take the same course of action when an author enquires about a publication date, as often this means that they are considering press. You will need to provide Emily with an estimated publication date so she can propose a date to them. Emily will then follow up with the authors directly, and let you know when the press date has been confirmed. You can then schedule this on Kriya as outlined [**above**](press-processes.md#marking-articles-in-kriya). 

![Email template in response to press queries](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-24-at-15.17.39.png)

The Production team is also copied into emails from both Emily and freelancers to Editorial Office, asking them to put recently accepted articles on hold whilst she looks into potential press, or for them to be scheduled if she has decided on press. You can read more about how to process these emails [**here**](toolkit/managing-production-queries.md#press-emails)**.** 

![Email requesting that a PoA be put on hold for potential press](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-24-at-15.13.34.png)

The Production team is also copied in to emails from Features to Emily informing her of publication dates for prospective insights, should she want to coordinate a press-release with the related article. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-16.24.24.png)

In their correspondence relating to press, authors sometimes enquire about embargo periods. In your reply, you can outline that because authors are completely free to release their content ahead of publication and to talk with the media at any stage, we do not release content under embargo, except under exceptional circumstances. Instead, we generally aim to promote an article as widely as possible at the time of publication. You should link to our media policy [**here**](https://elifesciences.org/media-policy)**.** 

![Author enquiring about an embargo](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-09.53.52.png)

### Press update email 

On Mondays at around 3.30pm, the Production team sends an email to Emily, updating her on the status of the press articles for the next day. It is important that the person sending the email cross-checks the press articles listed under the relevant date on the ****[**actions spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWMKdmcl4i7EC_bHvrbpBcUKoXuMQ4WfrVDJ1HxQ0cc/edit?ts=56dd55b5), with those listed on the [**manuscript tracker**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TVgTAUijt9pVa_d8TRFcpPvipE31zcgBh0r9M5dFn4Q/edit#gid=2075183460) ****and those on [**Continuum**](https://prod--ppp-dash.elifesciences.org/current). These articles should appear under the ****[**'Scheduled'**](https://prod--ppp-dash.elifesciences.org/scheduled?view=list&start=30-06-2021&end=30-06-2022) ****section on the Continuum dashboard. 

![Manuscript tracker outlining the expected press articles for the upcoming Tuesday ](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-24-at-16.26.56.png)

![Scheduled press article appearing under the &apos;Scheduled&apos; tab in Continuum](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-06-30-at-12.22.37.png)

As can be seen in the screenshot below, the email should clearly list all of the articles that have been scheduled, specifying the time and date and whether they have any related content such as an Insight. A press article will not be pushed back in the event that its related Insight is not ready. If a related co-publishing VoR is not ready, however, both articles will likely need to be pushed back. It would be advisable to check with the authors as to whether they would like to go ahead with press or wait for the other paper. In the event that any articles need to be pushed back, this should be indicated here, giving a clear reason for the delay so that Emily can inform the authors. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2021-07-14-at-08.46.44.png)

If an article still isn't scheduled on Monday afternoon but it has a press time of 12pm or later, depending on the scale of edits still needed, the article may still be able to make its press time. If a press article has not yet been scheduled, but it is expected that it will still make the press date, Emily should be sent a second email at the end of the day updating her on its status.
