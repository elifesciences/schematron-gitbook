# Ethics

## What are ethics in research?

All authors are expected to adhere to the guidelines set by their institutional review board or ethics committee when the study was approved. For example, animals should not undergo any unnecessary suffering if this can be avoided, and human participants should be be allowed confidentiality and data protection. 

## What needs to be checked?

We ask authors to provide an ethics statement during submission to indicate that the study has been approved and that the guidelines have been adhered to. 

## Examples

Give specific examples of everything that needs to be checked/any common problems. Add sub-sections where needed, but be as succinct as possible. Include screenshots as required.

This section should also list any issues that can be spotted without the need to run Schematron tests such as low figure quality, broken paragraphs, badly formatted tables etc. Crosscheck against the protocol documents in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2wDI5EMHiJ-UzctZnVBdWFwbzA).

> Any quotes from articles should be formatted as quotes

* Any Kriya queries should be formatted as a bullet point

Any [**hyperlinks**](untitled-4.md) to other pages or websites should be bolded to make sure they are more visible.
