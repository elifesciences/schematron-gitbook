# Template

## What is the \[insert subject of page\]?

Give a brief description of the subject being addressed in the page. 

## What needs to be checked?

Outline the main things that need to be checked. Include a checklist if possible.

## Examples

Give specific examples of everything that needs to be checked/any common problems. Add sub-sections where needed, but be as succinct as possible. Include screenshots as required.

This section should also list any issues that can be spotted without the need to run Schematron tests such as low figure quality, broken paragraphs, badly formatted tables etc. Crosscheck against the protocol documents in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2wDI5EMHiJ-UzctZnVBdWFwbzA).

> Any quotes from articles should be formatted as quotes

* Any Kriya queries should be formatted as a bullet point

Any [**hyperlinks**](untitled-4.md) to other pages or websites should be bolded to make sure they are more visible.
